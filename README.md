[link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/col341-a3). <br>

* Designed a **Deep CNN** model using transfer learning in PyTorch to detect yoga pose through various camera angles. <br>
* Transformed dataset images containing 19 Asanas to avoid the background misrecognition & better feature interpretation. <br>
* Developed **hybrid Densenet121** architecture with pretrained weights leveraging GPU acceleration using HPC for training.
